		<p class="para2"> One of my favourite books is The Five Second Rule by Mel Robbins. 
		<br>
		I bought this as an audio book after watching one of Mel's inspirational videos on YouTube. I was stuck and dealing 			with feeling unsure about how to tackle situations that seemed 'scary' to me and her video's made me feel she would 				be able to help.
		<br> 

		I was right, although I probably don't make use of the rule as regularly as I should, sometimes I hear myself 				count down 5, 4, 3, 2, 1 and I make that phone call or ask that question which I would have spent minutes 				(potentially hours) going over and over the best words to use to communicate and what I would do if the other person 			thought I was stupid! </p>
