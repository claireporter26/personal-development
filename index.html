		<h1> My Personal Development Resources </h1>


		<h2> My Own Journey So Far. </h2>

			<p class="para1"> A big hello to you! I have created this website in the hopes of helping you in your journey 			to becoming a more calm, focussed, creative and productive you. If you have come to this website you may be 				feeling a little stuck, a little lost or not quite sure what you are looking for, all feelings and emotions 			that all of us humans experience at some point 			during our lives. 
			
			<br>
			<br>

			I have felt that way myself at many points and I have not always dealt with it in the best way possible, 			however there is one thing 			that I have been certain of....only <b>I</b> could be the one to guide myself out of it.
			You may not want to hear that we are the only ones who can control how we feel, but there is also good 			news...these days there are 			endless resources available to help us. People who have been through similar experiences have written books 			and blogs, created 			YouTube videos and Podcasts in which they explain the techniques they used to break through and continue on 			or start to live a life 			they love.
			
			<br>
			<br>

			This website has been designed to provide you with some of my favourite resources to help you direct your 				actions towards a more fufilling life. </p>
